The apply method applies this normalization function to the DataFrame column Lyric, producing a cleaned version of the text.\n",

The final DataFrame includes columns for both normalized and lemmatized lyrics, ensuring the text is clean, concise, and ready for downstream NLP tasks like clustering or classification."
