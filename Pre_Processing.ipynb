        "\n",
        "#### This secitionn is to preprocess text documents, such as song lyrics, by normalizing and cleaning them for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It standardizes the text by converting it to lowercase, removing special characters, punctuation, and numbers, and filtering out both standard English stopwords and custom stopwords specific to the domain (e.g., filler words like \"yeah\" and \"gonna\"). The code tokenizes the text into individual words, removes irrelevant tokens, and handles stray apostrophes to produce a clean and consistent version of the input. This prepares the data for more effective analysis in tasks like clustering, classification, or sentiment analysis."
