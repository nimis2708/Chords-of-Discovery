This project proposes a music recommendation engine that takes a song title as input and leverages sentiment analysis to suggest similar songs. This solution aims to simplify the music discovery process by allowing users to explore new tracks based solely on the title of a song they like. This eliminates the need for additional input or technical knowledge. The target audience includes users who value simplicity, security, and efficiency in finding new music. This approach sets apart from existing solutions in the market. To build and train our recommendation algorithm, I utilize an existing dataset from Kaggle, enabling me to deliver more accurate and tailored suggestions.
